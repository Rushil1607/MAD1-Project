Hello this is Rushil Gupta! You are viewing my Grocery Store project.
In order to run my project, you need to open the project folder in VS code.
From there you need to go to the terminal (or launch one if you don't have a terminal open) and run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 
This will ensure that your system has all the installations necessary to run the project.
Once you've done that, run the command 'python app.py' in the terminal.
You'll see a link appear in the terminal which points to your localhost, press control+click on that link.
It would redirect to you a browser where you'll find my project running!
Please do not make any changes to the codes or the order and content of the folders if you want the application to run smoothly. 
Thank you!
